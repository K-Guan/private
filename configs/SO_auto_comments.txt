###[Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions. Thanks!

###[Q] OP use an image instead of code
Please post your code instead of an image. Just an image isn't helpful. Because we can't copy-paste your code to debug it or edit, fix it.

###[Q] Duplicate Closure
This question will probably be closed as a duplicate soon. If the answers from the duplicates don't fully address your question please edit it to include why and flag this for re-opening. Thanks!

###[Q] "Why won't it work?" questions with no code
It seems you have a problem with your code. However, we can't help unless we have [code or information that can reproduce the problem](http://$SITEURL$/help/mcve). Otherwise, we are just blindly guessing.

###[Q] "Need to make program" but no question
All that has been posted is a program description. However, we need you to [ask a question](http://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-ask). We can't be sure what you want from us. Please [edit] your post to include a valid question that we can answer. Reminder: make sure you know [what is on-topic here](http://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic), asking us to write the program for you and suggestions are off-topic.

###[Q] Many formatting issues
Take a moment to read through the [editing help](http://$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the help center. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites. The better your post looks, the easier it will be for users to help you.

###[Q] "It doesn't work" with no exception details
Can you elaborate on how your code "doesn't work"? What were you expecting, and what actually happened? If you got an exception, post the line it occurred on and the exception details. Please [edit] these details in or we may not be able to help.

###[Q] Ask OP to edit question instead of adding info in comments
Please [edit] your post to include any additional information you have to your question. Avoid adding this in the comments, as they are harder to read and can be deleted easier. The edit button for your post is just below the post's tags.

###[Q] Too many ways to solve the problem
There are too many ways to approach this problem. The answers would just turn into a straw-poll for which one people liked. The best thing is to do some research on the topic yourself, find two or three, _analyze_ them, determine if they work for you or not, and _try them out_. Come to use when you have a specific question about something you have attempted to do.

###[Q] Need to make changes to existing (missing) code
We won't know how to make the changes to your existing code base without seeing your original code. Please post [a minimal example of what needs to change](http://$SITEURL$/help/mcve), and fully explain what needs to be modified.

###[Q] Should go to CodeReview
It seems that your code currently works, and you are looking to improve it. Generally these questions are too opinionated for this site, but you might find better luck at [CodeReview.SE](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/tour). Remember to read [their requirements](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) as they are a bit more strict than this site.

###[Q] Should go to Software Recs
Unfortunately, questions asking us to recommend or find a book, tool, software library, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic here. However, you may find better luck [SoftwareRecs.SE](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/tour). Remember to read [their question requirements](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) as they are more strict than this site.

###[Q] Asking for code translation
$SITENAME$ is a Question and Answer site, not a code translation service. Try to translate the code yourself first, then come to us when you are stuck, making sure to show us [what you have tried](http://$SITEURL$/help/mcve).

###[Q] "Where do I start?" question
Questions that ask "where do I start" are typically too broad and are not a good fit for this site. People have their own method for approaching the problem and because of this there cannot be a _correct_ answer. Give a good read over [**Where to Start**](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/6366/where-to-start/6367#6367), then address your post.

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](//$SITEURL$/privileges/comment). For the moment I've added the comment for you, and I'm flagging this post for deletion.

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should [edit] your original question to add additional information. And then please delete this because it is not an answer and should not be posted this way.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Another user adding a 'Me too!'
If you have a NEW question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, [you may upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[A] Link Only same site
Please don't post link only answers to other $SITENAME$ questions. Instead, vote/flag to close as duplicate, or, if the question is not a duplicate, *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Please don't post answers
Please don't post answers on obviously off topic / bad questions! [See: **Should one advise on off topic questions?**](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/276572/1768232)

###[A] Identical answers
Please don't post identical answers to multiple questions. Post one good answer, then vote/flag to close the other questions as duplicates. If the question is not a duplicate, *tailor your answers to the question.*

###[A] Not enough rep to comment
Don't post answers to clarify another's answer. Since you don't have enough rep yet to comment, post your **own, complete answer** that can stand on its own if the other answer were to be deleted. Eventually you will have enough rep to comment on another's answer. Please [edit] this answer with additional details.

###[A] Self Promotion
Just linking to your own library or tutorial is not a good answer. Linking to it, explaining why it solves the problem, providing code on how to do so and disclaiming that you wrote it makes for a better answer. See: [**What signifies “Good” self promotion?**](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/182212/200235)

###[A] Question as an answer
Welcome to $SITENAME$! Please make sure that your answer is phrased *as an answer*, not as a question.

###[A] This question is a duplicate question
This question has been asked and answered before. If you think that you can improve upon the answers posted to the previously asked question, please edit or post your own answer. 

###[A] Link Only Other Stack Exchange
Please don't post link only answers to other Stack Exchange questions. Instead, include the essential portions of the answer here, and *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Language, please
I know you're excited, but please try to keep your language under control. Think of $SITENAME$ as more like Wikipedia than like Reddit.

###[A] Many formatting issues
Take a moment to read through the [editing help](http://$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the help center. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites.

###[A] Code only answer
While this code snippet may solve the question, [including an explanation](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114762/explaining-entirely-code-based-answers) really helps to improve the quality of your post. Remember that you are answering the question for readers in the future, and those people might not know the reasons for your code suggestion.

###[A] Borderline Link-Only answer
This is a borderline [link-only answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231/213671). You should expand your answer to include as much information here, and use the link only for reference.

###[A] Borderline-spam link answer
Please be careful with linking to your own content on different sites, you don't want to be a [spammer](http://$SITEURL$/help/promotion). You should be including the majority of the content here, and use the link only as a reference.

###[C] Too localized
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too localized.

###[C] Legal or Licensing Question
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because [licensing advice is off-topic on $SITENAME$.](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/274964/1402846) You may be able to get help on [Programmers Stack Exchange, but **read their faq carefully** before proceeding.](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/7265/when-is-a-software-licensing-question-on-topic)

###[C] We are not Customer Support
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because [we are not customer support for your favorite company](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/255745/).

###[EQ] Improper tagging
The tags you were using are not appropritate for this question. Please review [What are tags, and how should I use them?](//$SITEURL$/help/tagging)
